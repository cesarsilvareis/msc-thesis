#### Etiology & Pathophysiology - MCQ-o1 

---
**1. Which of the following organisms is the most common cause of infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users?**
a) Streptococcus viridans
b) Staphylococcus aureus
c) Enterococcus faecalis
d) Pseudomonas aeruginosa

**Correct Option:** b) Staphylococcus aureus
**Explanation:** Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users due to direct inoculation into the bloodstream.


#### Identification & Diagnosis - MCQ-o2

---
**1. A 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presents with fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. What is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis?**
a) Perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)
b) Order a chest X-ray
c) Initiate empirical antibiotic therapy
d) Conduct a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)

**Correct Option:** d) Conduct a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)
**Explanation:** TEE is more sensitive than TTE for detecting vegetations and complications in infective endocarditis, especially in high-risk patients like those with a history of intravenous drug use.


#### Identification & Diagnosis - MCQ-o3

---
**Which of the following is the most common initial clinical presentation of infective endocarditis?**
a) Acute respiratory distress
b) Fever and heart murmur
c) Sudden severe headache
d) Painless jaundice

**Correct Option:** b) Fever and heart murmur
**Explanation:** Fever and heart murmur are common initial signs of infective endocarditis, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.

a) To treat existing infections.
b) To prevent bacteremia during invasive procedures.
c) To strengthen the immune system.
d) To cure chronic endocarditis.

**Correct Option:** b) To prevent bacteremia during invasive procedures.
**Explanation:** Antibiotic prophylaxis is used to prevent bacteremia, which can lead to IE in at-risk patients undergoing invasive procedures.


#### Etiology & Pathophysiology - MCQ-o9

Great, I'll prepare an MCQ for your advanced medical students on the topic of Etiology & Pathophysiology of Infective Endocarditis.

---
**Which of the following organisms is most commonly associated with subacute infective endocarditis in patients with pre-existing valvular abnormalities?**
a) Staphylococcus aureus  
b) Streptococcus viridans  
c) Enterococcus faecalis  
d) Pseudomonas aeruginosa  

**Correct Option:** b) Streptococcus viridans
