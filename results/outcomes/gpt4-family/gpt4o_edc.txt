## Regular + Identification & Diagnosis (2) | Q4 in T3|6

### MCQ
**What is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosing infective endocarditis and detecting complications such as valvular vegetations?**

a) Chest X-ray
b) Transthoracic echocardiography
c) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
d) Positron emission tomography (PET) scan

**Correct Option:** b) Transthoracic echocardiography

**Explanation:** Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial imaging of choice for diagnosing infective endocarditis due to its high sensitivity in detecting valvular vegetations and other structural abnormalities of the heart.

### OUTCOME
**Comments:**

- Is an incorrect option selected as the solution? No

- Is there more than a single correct option possible? No

- Is the intended IE evaluative topic covered by the question? Yes

- Is the question complexity in line with the academic degree? No, the complexity is not fully appropriate because while transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is an initial imaging modality, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is actually more sensitive and specific for detecting valvular vegetations and other complications of infective endocarditis. This nuance might be important for an advanced-level student, but it should be clarified at the regular level as well.

**Improvement:**
I would suggest the following: Modify the question to include both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, highlighting the role of TTE as the initial test and TEE as the more sensitive and specific follow-up if TTE is inconclusive. This adjustment ensures the question is accurate and appropriately challenging for a 3rd-year medical student.

### MCQ
**A 48-year-old patient presents with a history of intravenous drug use and fever. Upon examination, a new-onset diastolic murmur is detected. Which valve is most commonly affected in intravenous drug users with Infective Endocarditis?**

a) Aortic valve
b) Mitral valve
c) Pulmonary valve
d) Tricuspid valve

**Correct Option:** d) Tricuspid valve

**Explanation:** Intravenous drug users commonly develop right-sided endocarditis affecting the tricuspid valve due to direct injection of contaminants into the venous system.

### OUTCOME
**Comments:**

Is an incorrect option selected as the solution? No

Is there more than a single correct option possible? No

Is the intended IE evaluative topic covered by the question? Yes

Is the question complexity in line with the academic degree? Yes

Improvement: I would suggest the following: While the question is accurate and suitable for the academic level, adding more clinical context or integrating another aspect of diagnosis or treatment could further enhance the questionâ€™s complexity. For instance, including details on diagnostic findings or treatment options might deepen the students' understanding and better evaluate their comprehensive knowledge on the topic.
