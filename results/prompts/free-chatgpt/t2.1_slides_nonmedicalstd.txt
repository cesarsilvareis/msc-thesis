{slide_body}
"""

### Body Restrictions ###
- Every slide_body has at most 25 words in a slide with at least 7 lines.
- Use bullet-list form as the primary textual element type.
- As pedagogical presentations seek attention and conveyance clarity beyond text, you are free to fill lines of any slide_body using the given structural elements (not counting to the word limit):
   - Images: """ **<img>** {image_caption} **</img>** """
   - Tables: """ **<tab>** {var1}/{var2} **</tab>** """
- Make the slides sound complete to the readers with concise information sustained on diverse images or tables.

===
Prompt 5: Towards Non-Medical Pursuits
Elaborate 5 theoretical slides where you show the Infective Endocarditis disease to non-medical students. Your generation should respect the established requirements and prescribed considerations below and the structure as follows (do not enclose in code "```"):

Slide format:"""
---
**Slide {slide_number}: {slide_title}**
{slide_body}
"""

### Body Restrictions ###
- Every slide_body has at most 25 words in a slide with at least 7 lines.
- Use bullet-list form as the primary textual element type.

- Make the slides sound complete to the readers with concise information sustained on diverse images or tables.

### Considerations ###
- All information in the generated slides should be clear, nonredundant, and appropriate to a professional and engaging medical presentation.
- Assume non-medical students could be nurses, microbiologists, or cardio-pneumologists.

===
