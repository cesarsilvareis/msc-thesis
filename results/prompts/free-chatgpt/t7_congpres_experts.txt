"""
---
**Slide {slide_number}: {slide_title}**

   - Tables: """ **<tab>** {table_caption} **</tab>** """
- Make the slides sound professional to the readers with concise information sustained on diverse images or tables with significant data.

### Planning Phase ###

2. Calculate an approximate number of content slides you need to generate for that, considering the temporal restrictions above;
3. Think about what would be also interesting to mention (ideas, significance of research findings and objectives) and formulate new related topics the presentation will base on beyond the illustrative Title slide, Introduction and Conclusion...
4. Build my presentation according to its layout considerations and what you have thought from previous steps;
5. Respect the output format: """
**Planning:**
*Theme Description:* {step1_reasoning}
