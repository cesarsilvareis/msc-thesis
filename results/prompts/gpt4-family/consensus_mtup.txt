[ MATERIAL ]
"""
Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the heart's inner lining or valves, primarily caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream. In Portugal, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are common culprits. Diagnosis involves clinical suspicion, blood cultures, echocardiography, and Duke criteria. Treatment typically requires prolonged intravenous antibiotics, tailored based on culture results. Complications include heart failure, embolic events, and valve damage. Prognosis depends on timely diagnosis and appropriate management, with mortality rates varying from 10% to 30%, but they can be higher in cases of complications.
